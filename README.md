# WEB322-Tools-and-Frameworks

This course teaches how to design and create web applications and services in JavaScript, using widely-used and powerful tools and frameworks. The main topics covered in this course include server and client programming techniques, an introduction to data storage schemes, and an introduction to security.

Upon completing this course, I was able to acquire skills such as:
- Comparing server-based and web client applications to make an informed decision about creating a server-based web application.
- Proposing a web application design based on a well-organized architecture and design principles to ensure reliability, quality, enhancement, maintenance, and adaptability.
- Configuring a web application server using widely-used open-source software (including Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB) to provide a solution to a business problem or opportunity.
- Demonstrating professional-level scripting skills to implement function closures, callbacks, asynchronous patterns, and debug an application.
- Designing programmatically generated web documents, using a view engine and a CSS framework, to present consistent, accessible, and attractively formatted content.
- Applying HTTP protocol elements, including messages, URI, clients, GET and POST requests, servers, and responses, to design and implement a modern standards-based web application.
- Creating a simple security system, including identity management, authentication, authorization, and resource sharing, to control access to a web application by authorized users.
- Selecting a suitable host for a published web application to enable access on the public web.
